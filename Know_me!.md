The below are the projects which I have tried and I have the code for them in my repository.
I've initially hosted them in Heroku but since they removed free dynos as of Nov2022, the sites stopped working.
Although you can use the codes from the repository which perfectly works in local host and you have to make some modifications to them inorder to host them in sites and it is different for each website hosting sites.I tried firebase but it had some issue in hosting nodejs apps.Anyway that can be solved but I dont have time to go through that since I made myself busy with other projects.That's why i removed the deployed sites and their links from this.
I have attached a readme file and screenshots of the working demo for each project.

I did a newsletter signup page that records the details and send it to my account.

I did a live Day and Date webpage.

I did a webpage that performs DMAS operations between two input numbers and displays result.

I did a webpage which gives LIVE WEATHER condition of the user input city!

I did a blog which shows the posts which can be composed and displayed in the home page. Built with Mongodb functionality for the posts to be saved and viewed later.
